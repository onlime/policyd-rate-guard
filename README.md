This project is going to be the successor of [ratelimit-policyd](https://github.com/onlime/ratelimit-policyd). **PolicydRateGuard** is a complete rewrite in Python which is currently under development in a pre-alpha state. It's not ready to be launched yet, but stay tuned!

We're going to release it by the end of summer, hopefully by the end of Sept 2023.

Until then, enjoy the heat and go for a swim.
